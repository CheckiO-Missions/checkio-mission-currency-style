            Light up üí°! We are going to use regular expression module in the solution. You need to create a pattern to match currency blocks of first style and replace all the blocks with the same text but changed to the second style.

<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        Ok, what should I start from?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            First you need to import module <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html">re</a> for work with regular expressions.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
import re
        </pre>
        <p>
            Your function should return the text with changed currency style. To replace parts of text and return the changed one, the module has <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.sub">re.sub()</a> function. So, you need to change every block that matches <b class="code">pattern</b> with changed <b class="code">reform</b> block in the given <b class="code">text</b>. Let's write it. 
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
return re.sub(pattern, reform, text)
        </pre>
    </div>
</div>

        Help me to write correct pattern.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            Yes, we do it step by step to gain better understanding. Your currency block always starts with <b class="code">$</b>. But since this character has special meaning in regular expressions, to ignore this special meaning and find exactly this character, use escape character <b class="code">\</b> before.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
"\$"
        </pre>
        <p>
            Now you need to find a first block of digits before the first separator, which may have from 1 to 3 digits, depending of the number (e.g. $1, $12, $123). Character <b class="code">d</b> stands for finding digits, but since we use its special meaning (not looking the letter "d" itself), we need escape character before. Set number of repetition in curly brackets.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
"d{1,3}"
        </pre>
        <p>
            The number may be big, so here you may have zero or more blocks of dot and three digits. Use escape character for dot and digit, set number of repetition for digits and the whole block.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
"(\.\d{3})*"
        </pre>
        <p>
            You may have zero or one block of comma and two digits as cents.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
"(,\d{2})?"
        </pre>
        <p>
            And finally, this must be the end of the number - not any digits after.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
"(?!\d)"
        </pre>
        <p>Join all above strings together to receive <b class="code">pattern</b>.</p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
pattern = "\$\d{1,3}(\.\d{3})*(,\d{2})?(?!\d)"
        </pre>
    </div>

        Wow! Everything is clear when explained! How to create a changed version from every match?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            Our <b class="code">reform</b> may be a function! In this case it would be be applied for every non-overlapping occurrence of pattern as <b class="code">match</b>. You may write the function using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lambda.asp">python_lambda</a> function.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
reform = lambda match: ...
        </pre>
        <p>
            Since the result of finding (<b class="code">match</b>) is an object itself, you need to specify, that you need just a whole string block. Use <b class="code">group()</b> or <b class="code">group(0)</b> for this. If you have inner groups in your pattern and need them directly, you may specify <b class="code">group(1), group(2) etc.</b>
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
reform = lambda match: match.group()
        </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        Ok, how to replace characters in the match?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            Since you need to replace two characters by their places in string, its good to use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_translate.asp">str.translate()</a> method and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_maketrans.asp">str.maketrans()</a> to specify characters without <b>ascii</b> codes.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
reform = lambda match: match.group().translate(str.maketrans(',.', '.,'))
        </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        So, how my final solution should look like?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            You just need to join previous hints wrap your code into function expression. Using type hints for input and output data are highly recommended.
        </p>
        <p>Here is the whole solution:</p>
        <div class="spoiler">
        <pre class="brush: python">
import re


def checkio(text: str) -> str:
    
    pattern = '\$\d{1,3}(\.\d{3})*(,\d{2})?(?!\d)'
    reform = lambda match: match.group().translate(str.maketrans(',.', '.,'))
    
    return re.sub(pattern, reform, text)
        </pre>
